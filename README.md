# Card-Game
Swift project I made with a classmate to mimic the card game 'Beggar My Neighbor'


Test you and a friend’s luck in the classic card game, Beggar My Neighbor, now an app!

—————————

To start game, click on either player’s deck, from there, the game Beggar My Neighbor will begin!

Game Rules:
A standard 52-card deck is divided equally between two players, and the two stacks of cards are placed on the table face down. The first player lays down his top card face up, and the opponent plays his top card, also face up, on it, and this goes on alternately as long as no ace or face card (king, queen, or jack) appears. These cards are called "penalty cards."

If either player turns up such a card, his opponent has to pay a penalty: four cards for an ace, three for a king, two for a queen, or one for a jack. When he has done so, the player of the penalty card wins the hand, takes all the cards in the pile and places them under his pack. The game continues in the same fashion, the winner having the advantage of placing the first card. However, if the second player turns up another ace or face card in the course of paying to the original penalty card, his payment ceases and the first player must pay to this new card. This changing of penalization can continue indefinitely. The hand is lost by the player who, in playing his penalty, turns up neither an ace nor a face card. Then, his opponent acquires all of the cards in the pile. When a single player has all of the cards in the deck in his stack, he has won.
